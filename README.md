# Backer UI

Backer UI is using [RollupJS](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) to build the bundle and [React Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to preview the components.

We also use [Chromatic] to test the components and preview them in the browser with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

### Backer UI Storybook

Storybook â€” https://main--629496e95fff28004a61a2a4.chromatic.com

Chromatic app â€” https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=629496e95fff28004a61a2a4

Ask for permission to use the storybook UI to preview the components. If you're memmber of the Backer team you should have permission automatically.

# Style guide

1. Use `@media`, `pseudo-classes`, `pseudo-elements` etc. only inside classes â€” no in the end of the file

```scss
.dot {
  opacity: 0.3;
  margin-right: 12px;
  transition: all 0.1s ease;
  
  &:last-child {
    margin-right: 0;
  }
  
  @media only screen and (max-width: $grid-tablet-breakpoint) {
    opacity: 0.4;
  }
}
```

2. Use `@media` from desktop to mobile

```scss
.dot {
  // default desktop

  @media only screen and (max-width: $grid-tablet-breakpoint) {
    // tablet
  }
  
  @media only screen and (max-width: $grid-mobile-breakpoint) {
    // mobile
  }
}

```

3. There are no cases where we use unproportional paddings or margins like `padding: 23px 0 35px 29px;`. If you see sizes like this â€” write to a  designer
