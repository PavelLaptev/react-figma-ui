# ðŸ¤– Welcome to Backer UI

Here you can find all the documentation for the components and the API. Backer UI is a React UI library that is built on top of [React](https://reactjs.org/).

All components in the library are core to the project and are used by the other components and application.

Repository [github.com/collegebacker/backer-ui](https://github.com/collegebacker/backer-ui) <br/>
Chromatic app [https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=629496e95fff28004a61a2a4](https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=629496e95fff28004a61a2a4)

# ðŸ›  How to use

## Installation

Add the line below to your `package.json` `dependencies` file. You can use the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) package manager. Do not forget to add the actual version of the library as a tag. View all tags [here](https://github.com/collegebacker/backer-ui/tags).

```json
"@collegebacker/backer-ui": "git://github.com/collegebacker/backer-ui.git#tag-version"
```

## Usage

After installing the library, you can use it by importing it in your application.

`import` global styles:

```scss
"@collegebacker/backer-ui/styles/all.scss";
```

`import` the components:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@collegebacker/backer-ui/ui'
```

# ðŸ§© Components

Backer UI has 3 types of components:

- **`Core`**: These are the core components that are used by the other components and application. <br/> They are outside the context.
- **`App`**: These are the components that are used by the application only.
- **`Marketing`**: These are the components that are used by the marketing components.

For now we merged the `core` components and the `marketing` components into one `ui` library. This will be changed in the future if there will be more stable components.

Let's store contextual components for the `app` and `marketing` components in they own repositories for now. It will speed up the development process until we need more control over the components.

## Desing sync

All components here are synced with the [Figma design system](https://www.figma.com/files/project/11368881/%F0%9F%A7%AC-DNA?fuid=1090441672799451683).

# ðŸŽ¨ Tokens

For any UI, no matter the context, there are tokens that are used to style the components.

- **`colors.css`** - This file contains all the colors used in the UI in native css format.
- **`_grids.scss`**
- **`_spacers.scss`**
- **`_typography-common.scss`**
- **`_typography-app.csss`**
- **`_typography-marketing.scss`**
- **`_radii.scss`**

# ðŸ’… Styles

In order to convey the best experience for the user and make the development process easier, we use the following styles:

  If you want to skip manually importing the styles, you can use this file.
- **`reset.css`** - Reset styles
- **`fonts.css`** - Load fonts
- **`global.css`** - Global styles that fixed initial styles
- **`typography-app.scss`** - App styles
- **`typography-marketing.scss`** - Marketing styles
